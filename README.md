# Important Info
**The game is now using [mod.io](https://oldworld.mod.io/) for mod-support in their game which was implemented with the latest patch (20th July).<br>
You can still add them manually like before (github) but it would be certainly easier for you to create a [mod.io](https://oldworld.mod.io/) profile and get the mods and updates for them through the game now.**
